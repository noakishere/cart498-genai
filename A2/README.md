### Original Poem

One must have a mind of winter

To regard the frost and the boughs

Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;

And have been cold a long time

To behold the junipers shagged with ice,

The spruces rough in the distant glitter

Of the January sun; and not to think

For the listener, who listens in the snow,

And, nothing himself, beholds

Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.

That is blowing in the same bare air

For the listener, who listens in the morning

And, nothing himself, I

Nothing that is not there and the nothing that isn

The spruces rough in the distant ,

Of the January sun; and not to say

Of any misery in the sound of the world

In the sound of a few gunshots

Which is the sound of the engine

Full of the same name

That is blowing in the same bare chest

For the listener, who listens in the first

And, nothing himself, no

Nothing that is not there and the nothing that was
