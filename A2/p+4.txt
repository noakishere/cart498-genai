One must have a mind of your
To regard the frost and the ice
Of the pine-trees crusted with salt
And have been cold a long time now
To behold the junipers shagged with blood
The spruces rough in the distant ,
Of the January sun; and not to say
Of any misery in the sound of the world
In the sound of a few gunshots
Which is the sound of the engine
Full of the same name
That is blowing in the same bare chest
For the listener, who listens in the first
And, nothing himself, no
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that was
